# R & Python & Quarto - Some Examples

Below we mix R and Python code chunks with text and figures. The code chunks are evaluated and the results are displayed in the document. The code chunks are also saved as separate files, which can be used to generate the results in other documents.

## R Example

For a demonstration of a density plot generated using R, see @fig-density.

```{r}
#| label: fig-density
#| fig-cap: "A density plot generated using R"
plot(density(rnorm(10^4)),main="")
```

## Python Example

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis generated using python, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis generated using python"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
